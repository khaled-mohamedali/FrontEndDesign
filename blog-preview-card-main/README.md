## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of:

1. Centering elements both horizontally and vertically using Flexbox:
```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```
